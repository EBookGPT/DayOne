# Chapter 11: Conclusion - Making the Most Out of Day One

Congratulations on making it this far! Throughout this book, we have explored the different phases and processes of the onboarding journey, with a focus on the crucial first day. By now, you should have a good understanding of what it takes to create an effective Day One program.

As we bring this book to a close, we want to leave you with some final thoughts and advice. Remember that Day One is just the beginning of a longer onboarding journey, and that the work you put in on the first day will have a significant impact on the success of the rest of the journey.

We are joined by special guest Amy Cuddy, social psychologist and expert on nonverbal behavior. Here are some thoughts from Amy on creating a successful Day One experience:

"Day One is all about making a good first impression. But what many people don't realize is that first impressions are not just about what you say, but how you say it. Nonverbal cues like body language and eye contact can play a significant role in how people perceive you.

So my advice for Day One is to be mindful of your nonverbal behavior. Stand tall, make eye contact, and smile. These simple actions can help you connect with your colleagues and create a positive first impression."

In addition to Amy's advice, here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare for and execute your Day One program:

- Be organized and prepared: Make sure you have everything you need ready to go on Day One, including paperwork, equipment, and a detailed schedule. This will help things run smoothly and set the tone for the rest of the onboarding process.

- Focus on engagement: Day One is a chance to engage new hires, make them feel welcome, and get them excited about their new role. Plan activities and interactions that encourage participation and collaboration.

- Monitor progress: Keep an eye on new hires' progress throughout the onboarding journey, and be ready to make adjustments as needed. Regular check-ins, surveys, and other feedback mechanisms can help you track progress and identify areas for improvement.

At the end of the day, remember that Day One is just the beginning of the journey. By investing in a comprehensive onboarding program that includes a strong Day One experience, you can set your new hires up for success and help them thrive in their new roles.
# Chapter 11: Conclusion - Making the Most Out of Day One

In the land of Igbo, there once lived a great king named Obasi. Obasi was a wise ruler who was beloved by his people. However, he knew that in order to ensure the success of his kingdom, he needed to find and train the best warriors, farmers, and scholars.

And so, Obasi called upon the gods of Olympus to help him create a powerful onboarding program that would attract the most talented individuals from around the land. The gods, amused by Obasi's request, listened intently and decided to help in their own unique ways.

First, Athena, the goddess of wisdom, appeared before Obasi and infused him with knowledge and insights on how to create a Day One program that would prepare new hires for success. She shared her wisdom on the importance of preparation, communication, and engagement, and helped Obasi develop an orientation and induction plan that was both comprehensive and memorable.

Next, Apollo, the god of the arts, stepped forward and showed Obasi how to infuse creativity and color into the onboarding process. He taught Obasi about the power of storytelling, song, and visual aids in capturing the hearts of the new hires and getting them excited about their new roles. With Apollo's guidance, Obasi created a Day One checklist that was both beautiful and informative.

As Obasi's Day One program started to take shape, he realized that he needed to ensure that his new hires were fully engaged and felt welcomed by the kingdom. And so, he called upon the goddess Aphrodite, who knew everything about the art of seduction and persuasion. Aphrodite showed Obasi how to design activities and interactions that encouraged participation and collaboration, and helped him create an environment that was inviting and friendly.

However, even with the help of the gods, Obasi knew that there would be challenges on Day One. He needed a hero who could help his new hires navigate through the stormy waters of uncertainty and doubt. And so, he called upon the mighty Hercules, the strongest of all the gods. Hercules showed Obasi how to prepare for common challenges on Day One, such as technical issues or confusion about company policies, and taught him how to respond with strength and grace.

Finally, as Obasi's Day One program came to a close, he realized that he needed to measure its success and ensure that it was achieving its goals. And so, he called upon the goddess Artemis, the goddess of the hunt and founder of track and field. Artemis showed Obasi how to measure the success of his onboarding program and taught him about the power of surveys, feedback mechanisms, and regular check-ins.

With the help of the gods, Obasi was able to create a powerful Day One program that attracted the most talented individuals to his kingdom. And as he looked at the happy and engaged new hires, he knew that he had made the right decision. And so, he raised a glass to the gods and thanked them for their help in creating a successful Day One program.

This story teaches us that with the help of the right tools, resources, and guidance, we can create an effective Day One program that sets our new hires up for success. And with the advice and guidance from experts like social psychologist Amy Cuddy, we can ensure that we are creating a program that is engaging, memorable, and effective. So go forth, my friends, and create a Day One program that will take your kingdom to new heights of success and prosperity!
The Greek Mythology epic presented in this chapter is a fictional story that highlights the importance of creating a powerful Day One program for new hires. While the story itself is not based on any specific code patterns or algorithms, it does offer some valuable lessons that can be applied to building a successful onboarding program.

However, there are several software tools that can be used to support the various aspects of a Day One program. For example, tools like Talent LMS or Cornerstone OnDemand can help to automate the orientation and induction process and track the progress of new hires.

Similarly, employee engagement tools like TINYpulse or Officevibe can be used to create feedback loops that allow new hires to provide feedback on their onboarding experience and help improve the process over time.

Overall, the key to building a successful Day One program is to leverage a combination of software tools and human expertise to create a cohesive and effective program. The story of Obasi and the gods highlights the importance of seeking out the right guidance and support to ensure success, just as a strong onboarding program requires the guidance of experts like Amy Cuddy and the support of tools that can automate and measure the process.
