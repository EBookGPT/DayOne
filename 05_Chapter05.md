# Chapter 5: Onboarding Process and Procedures - The Tale of Oduduwa's Journey
In the land of the Igbo people of West Africa, there was a great king named Oduduwa. He was a wise and just ruler, beloved by his people. One day, Oduduwa decided to go on a journey to consult with the gods about how he could make his kingdom even more prosperous and peaceful. 

Oduduwa traveled for many weeks through forests and across rivers until he came to a grand temple at the top of a mountain. There he met with the goddess of wisdom, who told him he needed to bring new members to his kingdom who would bring fresh ideas and new skills. 

So Oduduwa went back to his kingdom and began to seek out those who could contribute to his kingdom's growth. He found Kelly Palmer, a renowned learning expert, who had traveled from a faraway land. She shared with him the secrets of how to build a world-class onboarding program that would ensure new members feel welcomed, supported, and ready for success. 

Oduduwa listened carefully and then summoned his best scholars and scribes to record the new wisdom. They developed a comprehensive onboarding plan that included clear goals, timelines, and resources. New members were also provided access to necessary information and training materials. 

To ensure the new members would be supported and heard at all times, Oduduwa appointed his most trusted advisers as mentors to the new members. They would provide ongoing support, feedback and guidance that would help the new members adjust to the fast-paced work of the kingdom. 

From that day forward, Oduduwa's kingdom prospered even more thanks to the new members who had joined. They brought with them the new skills and creative ideas that made the kingdom even more successful.

The onboarding program became known across the land as the "Oduduwa Way". And for generations to come, new members would be welcomed with open arms and great opportunities for growth and success through the onboarding process.

And so ends the tale of Oduduwa's Journey, a tale of the importance of providing proper onboarding for new members in any endeavor.

Code Sample:
```
const onboardingProgram = {
  goals: ['acquaint new employees with the company culture and values', 'provide employees with necessary information and training', 'ensure their onboarding journey is supported by expert mentors'],
  timeline: 'First 90 days of employment',
  resources: ['employee handbook', 'training modules', 'mentorship program'],
  feedback: ['regular check-ins', 'feedback surveys'],
  successMeasures: ['improved employee engagement', 'higher retention rates', 'boosted productivity']
}

function createOnboardingPlan(newEmployee) {
  const plan = {
    employee: newEmployee,
    onboardingStart: Date.now(),
    onboardingStatus: 'In progress',
    onboardingProgress: ['Introduction and Tour', 'Training modules', 'Mentor check-ins'],
    goalsAchieved: [],
    feedbackReceived: []
  }
  return plan;
}
```
Certainly! In the epic tale of Oduduwa's Journey, we followed the king's quest to create a world-class onboarding program for new members of his kingdom. To bring this tale to life, we included a code example for creating an onboarding plan, which we'll explain below.

The code example is written in JavaScript, a popular programming language used by many web developers. It begins with the creation of an object called `onboardingProgram`, which has various properties defining the goals, timeline, resources, feedback methods, and success measures of the program.

The `createOnboardingPlan` function has a parameter `newEmployee`, which represents the employee who will be going through the onboarding process. When called, this function creates a new object called `plan`, which has properties such as `employee`, `onboardingStart`, `onboardingStatus`, `onboardingProgress`, `goalsAchieved`, and `feedbackReceived`.

Here's a breakdown of what each of these properties means:

- `employee`: this property is set to the value of the `newEmployee` parameter passed in when the function is called. It stores information about the new employee that will be needed throughout the onboarding process.
- `onboardingStart`: this property records the time when the onboarding process for the new employee began. It uses JavaScript's built-in `Date.now()` method to get the current timestamp in milliseconds.
- `onboardingStatus`: this property starts as `'In progress'` but can be updated later to indicate if the onboarding process has been completed or terminated.
- `onboardingProgress`: this property is an array that stores the various steps or phases of the onboarding process that the new employee has completed. It starts with `'Introduction and Tour'` but can be updated to track the employee's progress through training modules or mentor check-ins.
- `goalsAchieved`: this property is also an array that stores the goals of the onboarding program achieved by the new employee. Once the employee has completed a specific training module or has the necessary information needed, the` goalsAchieved` are updated.
- `feedbackReceived`: this property is an array storing feedback or critiques from the new employee. After the new employee has gone through each step, they provide feedback that will be used to update, improve and create a better onboarding experience.

Overall, this code illustrates how a comprehensive onboarding plan can be created efficiently and effectively for new team members. By taking a structured and organized approach, organizations like Oduduwa's kingdom can ensure that new employees feel welcome, supported, and ready for success from day one.
