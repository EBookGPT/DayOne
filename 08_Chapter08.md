# Chapter 8: Common Challenges on Day One

## Introduction

Congratulations! You have successfully made it through the first chapter of this book! By now, you have learned the importance of employee engagement on Day One, but that is just the beginning. While there are many things that can go right on Day One, as we know, there are also many things that can go wrong. In this chapter, we'll discuss some of the most common challenges faced by new employees and explore ways to overcome them.

To help us gain further insight into this complex topic, we have a special guest joining us today. Brene Brown, a research professor and best-selling author, has dedicated her career to studying the intricacies of human connection and vulnerability. Her work has been featured in numerous publications, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. We are honored to have her expertise as we delve into the challenges of Day One.

## The Challenges

One of the most common challenges faced by new hires is the feeling of being overwhelmed. Starting a new job comes with a lot of new information, new people, and a new environment. It's easy to feel like you're swimming in a sea of unknowns. 

Another challenge is dealing with imposter syndrome. Many new employees feel like they don't belong or that they are not good enough for the job. This feeling can be overwhelming and, if left unchecked, can lead to decreased self-confidence and poor job performance.

New employees may also struggle with social connections. Building relationships with coworkers can be difficult, especially when you're the new kid on the block. This can be compounded by cultural differences, making it challenging to navigate new social situations.

## Overcoming the Challenges

So, what can new employees do to combat these challenges? The first step is to acknowledge that these feelings are normal. Almost everyone feels overwhelmed or unworthy at some point in their careers. The important thing is to recognize that these feelings are temporary and that they will pass.

One way to overcome imposter syndrome is by focusing on your strengths. Take the time to reflect on what you bring to the table and the unique value you add to the organization. Remember, you were chosen for this job for a reason. 

As for building social connections, it's important to be intentional. Put yourself out there by attending social events or reaching out to colleagues for coffee or lunch. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable and share your own experiences. You might be surprised by how many of your coworkers have gone through similar challenges.

## Conclusion

Starting a new job is a rollercoaster ride full of ups and downs. It's important to embrace the challenges and remember that they are a normal part of the process. By acknowledging your feelings, focusing on your strengths, and being intentional about building social connections, you can overcome the hurdles of Day One.

We hope this chapter has been helpful for you. And a huge thank you to Brene Brown for sharing her valuable insights with us. In the next chapter, we'll explore the topic of onboarding and its importance in setting employees up for success.
# The Trials of Day One: A Greek Mythology Epic

Once upon a time, in the land of Igboland, there was a young woman named Akunna. Despite her many talents and achievements, Akunna felt a deep sense of unease as she prepared to start a new job at a prestigious company. She worried that she wasn't good enough for the job and that her coworkers would see through her facade. 

As Akunna journeyed towards her new workplace, she encountered a figure by the side of the road. It was Brene Brown, a wise and powerful research professor, who had come to guide Akunna through the trials of Day One.

"Great goddess," exclaimed Akunna, "what brings you to Igbo land?"

"I have come to help those who face the challenges of Day One," replied Brene. "It can be a daunting journey, but with the right tools and mindset, you can overcome all obstacles."

With Brene by her side, Akunna entered her new workplace, feeling slightly more confident. But she was soon overcome by the many challenges of Day One.

She became overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information she was expected to learn, her mind racing to remember all the names, policies, and procedures. She felt lost and alone amidst the sea of new faces, each one a stranger in a foreign land.

But Brene was there to help her navigate the obstacles. She reminded Akunna to breathe and take things one step at a time. She encouraged her to ask questions and seek help when needed. And she reminded her that everyone goes through the same struggles on Day One. 

As the day wore on, Akunna began to feel more comfortable in her new surroundings. She found joy in sharing her story with her coworkers, learning about their experiences and struggles. She discovered that she wasn't alone in feeling overwhelmed, and that everyone could benefit from a little kindness and understanding.

Through the guidance of Brene Brown, Akunna learned to embrace the challenges of Day One, seeing them as opportunities for growth and learning. She learned to be vulnerable, to ask for help when needed, and to acknowledge her own worth and strengths.

And as she completed her first day on the job, Akunna knew that she had the strength and resilience to succeed in any challenge that lay ahead.

### Code Sample

Here's an example of using Python to help overcome the challenge of feeling overwhelmed on Day One by breaking down a task into smaller, manageable steps:

```python
# Example: Breaking down a task into smaller steps

task = "Create a report on Q1 sales numbers"
subtasks = ["Gather data on sales numbers", "Analyze data", "Organize findings into a report"]

for subtask in subtasks:
    print("Next step:", subtask)
```

This code creates a list of subtasks for a larger project and then iterates through each of them, printing out the next step to take. It's a simple way to break down a complex task into smaller pieces, making it more manageable and less overwhelming.
In the Greek Mythology epic, Akunna faces various challenges on her first day at her new job. One of her challenges is feeling overwhelmed by the amount of new information she's expected to learn. To overcome this challenge, we introduced a Python code sample that demonstrates how to break down a large task into smaller, more manageable steps.

In the code sample, we start by defining a large task - creating a report on Q1 sales numbers. Then, we create a list of subtasks that are needed to accomplish the larger task: gathering data on sales numbers, analyzing the data, and organizing findings into a report.

Using a `for` loop, we iterate through each subtask in the list, printing out the next step to take. By breaking down the larger task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, we can focus on taking one step at a time, which can help reduce feelings of overwhelming stress or anxiety.

This code sample demonstrates a practical application of a core principle of project management: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. By using Python to automate this process, we can reduce cognitive overload and increase productivity and focus on our work.
