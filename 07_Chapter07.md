_"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do."_ - Steve Jobs

Employee engagement is one of the most significant indicators of organizational success. The level of engagement of employees on day one of their new job can set the tone for the rest of their tenure with the company. Hence, employee engagement on Day One is more than just an HR buzzword, it is a crucial aspect of the onboarding process.

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of a day one checklist for successful onboarding. This chapter delves deeper by exploring how to create an engaging onboarding process that sets the right tone for new employees. A well-engaged employee will be more enthusiastic, flexible, and productive.

To engage your employees well on Day One, you need to have a comprehensive approach that begins before an employee's first day on the job. The day one checklist does assist with the practical aspects of onboarding, but what about the emotional aspect of joining a new team? How can you create an environment that welcomes, energizes, and motivates new employees? 

In this chapter, we will discuss how best to engage new employees from start to finish by using Greek Mythology to illustrate the importance of employee engagement. We will teach you how to weave practical assignments into personalized experiences that help employees understand their individual roles and how they fit into the company's culture. Furthermore, we will educate you on how to create a warm environment for your employees by offering them a mentor and showing them appreciation through rewards.

Get ready to embark on a journey of discovery as we explore the world of employee engagement with Day One in mind.
# Chapter 7: Employee Engagement on Day One - A Greek Mythology Epic

In the land of West Africa, there once was a great kingdom known as Igbo. This kingdom was known far and wide for its valiant warriors and wise priests. A young warrior named Ikenna had just joined King Obinna's army after a long journey.

On his first day of service, Ikenna was greeted by the king himself, who gave him a warm smile and welcomed him into the fold. Ikenna felt a deep sense of pride as he took in the grandeur of the kingdom, but he also felt a twinge of nervousness. As a new member of the army, he wanted to prove his worth and make a positive impact.

The king noticed his nerves and took it upon himself to ensure Ikenna's Day One was unforgettable. The king summoned his top priestess, Ada, who was known for her mastery of the art of storytelling. Ada arrived at the barracks and promptly began to weave a tale of Greek Mythology.

_"Listen carefully, young Ikenna,"_ Ada said. _"In ancient Greek Mythology, there was a powerful god named Prometheus, who gifted humans with the power of fire."_ 

Ikenna leaned in closely as Ada continued to speak. She told him of how Prometheus had given humans a precious gift, but in return, had incurred the wrath of the all-powerful Zeus.

_"Prometheus was punished for his actions by being chained to a rock and having his liver eaten by an eagle every day. However, eventually, the mighty hero Hercules came to his rescue."_ Ada said.

The story fascinated Ikenna, and he saw how this lesson could apply to his Day One experience. The gift that Prometheus had given to humans was something that they had grown to cherish and rely on. In the same way, Ikenna believed that the gift that the kingdom had given him was a career opportunity.

He realized that it was his duty to embrace the gift and learn how he could use his skills to add value to the army. In doing so, Ikenna knew he could make a significant impact and show his adherence to the kingdom's values.

Ada had successfully engaged Ikenna on his Day One, and the story had left him with a deep sense of appreciation for the kingdom's history and customs. Ikenna's engagement would translate into his commitment to making the new army his home, and he truly believed that he could help make it even greater.

As an HR personnel or manager, you too can engage your new employees with storytelling and history lessons that apply to your company's mission and values. This approach can help employees connect with the organization's mission and see their role in achieving it. Ada's Greek Mythology tale is a powerful illustration of the importance of employee engagement on Day One, and with the right approach, you can create a similar impact, leaving your new employees eager to contribute and make an impact in their new roles. 

Prometheus's story also teaches us the importance of being bold and innovative in the face of challenges. Just as Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gifted it to humans, companies must be willing to take risks and embrace change if they hope to succeed in today's fast-paced business landscape.

Prometheus's daring actions may have led to his downfall, but his perseverance and determination inspired others to follow in his footsteps. Within organizations, a similar spirit of innovation and determination is required to remain competitive and relevant. Harnessing that spirit is what will make organizations like the kingdom of Igbo to continue to grow and prosper.
# The Code used to Resolve the Greek Mythology Epic

In the Greek Mythology epic provided, Ada the priestess used storytelling to engage new recruit Ikenna on his first day in the army. This approach was successful in keeping Ikenna engaged and helped him connect with the kingdom's history and customs. The question is, what can HR personnel or managers use to achieve similar results of engagement and involvement from their new employees? 

Here are a few code examples of measures organizations can put in place to engage new employees on Day One and beyond:

## Personalized Assignments

Organizations can assign new employees personalized projects that align with their interests and relate to their specific role in the company. Such an approach helps employees take ownership of their jobs and makes them feel valued. A code implementation of this could take the form of:

```python
def assign_personalized_project(employee):
    """
    Assigns a personalized project to each employee.
    """
    project = employee.skills[random.randint(0, len(employee.skills) - 1)] + "_project"
    employee.skills.append(project)
    return project
```
The above code creates a function that takes an employee object and assigns a personalized project to them based on their skills. The project is then appended to the employee's skills.

## Creating a Warm Environment - Offer Mentors

The new job can be overwhelming for new employees, especially when it involves a new work culture. Providing mentors helps new employees learn the ropes quickly and can ease their transition into their new role. A code implementation of this could take the form of:

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, jobtitle, mentor = None):
        self.name = name
        self.jobtitle = jobtitle
        self.mentor = mentor
```

The above code shows the implementation of a mentorship program by incorporating a mentor parameter into the Employee class.

## Showing Appreciation through Rewards

Rewards can be a powerful tool in employee engagement, especially when they are designed specifically for the new employee to feel valued. Rewards can range from small gestures such as gift cards to larger incentives such as bonuses. A code implementation of this could take the form of:

```python
def give_reward(employee, reward_type):
    if reward_type == "gift_card":
        employee.reward_points += 50
    elif reward_type == "bonus":
        employee.reward_points += 100
    else:
        print("Invalid reward type")

employee1 = Employee("Ikenna", "Warrior", mentor = Ada)
give_reward(employee1, "gift_card")
print("Reward Points: ", employee1.reward_points)
```

The above code creates a function that takes an employee object and a reward type, which is then used to update the employee's reward points. Reward points can be redeemed for various rewards such as gift cards and bonuses.

Incorporating these measures and more in the onboarding process will lead to a higher level of employee engagement on Day One and beyond. By investing in your employees' engagement, you are investing in your company's success.
