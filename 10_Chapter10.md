# Chapter 10 - Best Practices for Day One Success

Congratulations! You’ve made it to chapter 10, where we’ll share some of the best practices to ensure your Day One onboarding process is successful. If you’ve followed us so far, you’ve learned about the importance of a great first impression, measuring success, and tips to make your onboarding process more efficient. 

As you continue to embark on this exciting journey, it’s important to remember that Day One onboarding is just as important for the company as it is for the new employee. The first day sets the tone for the rest of the employee's tenure, and you want to make sure their experience is unforgettable. 

There are a few things to keep in mind when planning your Day One onboarding process. First, provide a warm welcome to your new employee. Make sure they are greeted by a friendly face and feel at home in their new surroundings. This can go a long way in alleviating any nervousness or uncertainty the new employee may have. 

Secondly, establish clear communication from the very start. From scheduling the interview to the first day on the job, make sure your new employee knows exactly where they need to be, at what time and what they’ll be expected to do. A company handbook or a detailed list of policies and procedures should be provided, along with contact details for their immediate supervisor or HR personnel for any questions or concerns they may have.

Lastly, it’s always a great idea to have a buddy system in place. A mentor or trained buddy can help the new employee navigate not only the company culture but the work itself. Research from Harvard Business Review shows that having a buddy with whom you can discuss concerns can make new hires 63% more likely to stay with the company one year later.

Ready to make your Day One onboarding process even more successful? Keep these best practices in mind, and you'll be well on your way to creating a memorable experience for your new employee.

```python
def welcome_new_employee():
    print("Welcome to the team! We are thrilled to have you here and look forward to seeing all that you accomplish.")
    print("Please reach out to HR or your supervisor at any point during your onboarding process with any questions or concerns you may have.")
    
def establish_clear_communication():
    schedule_interview = "Interview is at 2 pm on Monday and HR will send all the details to your email address."
    expectations = ["Office dress code is business casual", "Work hours are from 9 am to 5 pm", "Lunch is on us on your first day!"]
    print(f"Here are the first couple of things you need to know. {schedule_interview} These are our expectations from you - {expectations}")

def assign_buddy():
    buddy = "Ugochukwu"
    print(f"You will be paired with {buddy} who will help you settle in and get up to speed with everything.")

# The Quest for a Memorable Day One

In the land of West Africa, there lived a great and wise leader named Obi. Obi ruled with fairness and justice, but he saw that his kingdom was in need of new talents to help the people thrive. And so, Obi summoned his most trusted advisors to devise a plan to bring in new talent from far and wide.

The advisors all agreed that the first step in bringing in new talent was to create an unforgettable Day One onboarding experience. They knew the importance of making a great first impression and how it could set the tone for the rest of an individual's time at the company. However, they knew that this was no easy task and that they needed outside help.

Obi then summoned the most skilled Oracle in all the land of West Africa. The Oracle was known to possess great knowledge and foresight as well as the ability to predict the future. Obi and his advisors asked the Oracle for guidance on how they could create a remarkable Day One onboarding experience.

The Oracle suggested that they provide a warm welcome to the new hires, clear communication from the start, and a buddy system to help guide the new employees. He said that these three things would make for a memorable Day One.

The advisors, eager to put the Oracle’s advice into action, began to prepare a grand welcoming event for the new hires. They prepared songs, dances, and food for the new employees to enjoy. With everyone feeling welcomed and at home, the advisors went on to the next step.

To establish clear communication, the advisors created a handbook for the new employees that outlined the company's policies and procedures. The handbook also included contact information for HR and the employees' supervisors in case they had any questions or concerns. The new employees received this handbook on Day One and were able to go through it at their own pace.

Lastly, the advisors appointed mentors or buddies for the new employees. These buddies would help guide the new hires through their first few weeks on the job, answering any questions they had along the way. The buddies would introduce the new hires to their new coworkers and show them around the office, making them feel like part of the team.

The new employees, having gone through such a wonderful Day One onboarding experience, felt a deep sense of belonging and were excited to begin their new jobs. They worked hard, using their skills to help the people of the kingdom thrive. And Obi, pleased with his advisors' work, knew that he had made the right decision in bringing in new talent.

Just like Obi and his advisors, you too can create a remarkable Day One onboarding experience by following the Oracle's advice. A warm welcome, clear communication, and a buddy system can work wonders in making new employees feel at home and excited to join your team.

```python
def grand_welcome():
    print("We welcome you to our team with open arms! We have prepared music, food, and entertainment for you to enjoy today. Please don’t hesitate to join the fun.")

def clear_communication():
    print("Here's a handbook on our company policies and procedures. You can refer to this document whenever you have any questions.")
    print("Please reach out to HR or your supervisor if you have any further queries.")

def buddy_system():
    buddy = "Unachukwu"
    print(f"You will be paired with {buddy} who will act as your mentor, your guide and your confidante during your onboarding journey.")
```
In the Greek Mythology epic, we talked about the importance of a great Day One onboarding process for new employees. We also shared the best practices to ensure a successful onboarding experience, which included providing a warm welcome, clear communication, and a buddy system for new employees. 

To illustrate these practices, we shared some code samples in python to provide an idea of how to implement these best practices.

```python
def grand_welcome():
    print("We welcome you to our team with open arms! We have prepared music, food, and entertainment for you to enjoy today. Please don’t hesitate to join the fun.")
```

In the grand_welcome function, we provide an example of how to create a warm welcome for new employees on their first day. It's always a great idea to make new employees feel at home by providing a welcoming environment and making sure they feel included in the team's activities.

```python
def clear_communication():
    print("Here's a handbook on our company policies and procedures. You can refer to this document whenever you have any questions.")
    print("Please reach out to HR or your supervisor if you have any further queries.")
```

In the clear_communication function, we provide an example of how to create clear communication from the start. A handbook or a detailed list of policies and procedures should be provided to new employees. It's essential to ensure they understand the expectations and what's expected of them to make their first day a success.

```python
def buddy_system():
    buddy = "Unachukwu"
    print(f"You will be paired with {buddy} who will act as your mentor, your guide, and your confidante during your onboarding journey.")
```

In the buddy_system function, we provide an example of how to create an effective buddy system as part of the onboarding process. Pairing new employees with a mentor or buddy can make new hires feel more comfortable and speed up their learning process. A buddy can offer guidance and support to new employees, making them feel less anxious and more at ease with the new company.

By implementing these best practices, you can create a memorable and successful Day One onboarding experience for your new hires!
